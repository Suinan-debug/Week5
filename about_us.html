          <p>
            Bank of China is the bank with the longest continuous operation
            among Chinese banks. Formally established in February 1912, the Bank
            served consecutively as the country’s central bank, international
            exchange bank and specialized international trade bank. After 1949,
            the Bank became responsible for managing China’s foreign exchange
            operations and offering international trade settlement, overseas
            fund transfer and other non-trade foreign exchange services. The
            Bank provides various financial services, and has developed into a
            large commercial bank delivering services in local and foreign
            currencies and featuring complete business varieties and financial
            strength. The Bank was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and
            the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2006, becoming the first Chinese bank
            to launch an A-Share and H-Share initial public offering and achieve
            a dual listing in both markets. The Bank is the official banking
            partner of the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics and the Beijing 2022
            Winter Olympics, thus making it the only bank in China to serve two
            Olympic Games. In 2011, Bank of China became the first financial
            institution from an emerging economy to be designated as a Global
            Systemically Important Bank, a designation it has now maintained for
            12 consecutive years. With its growing international status,
            competitiveness and comprehensive strengths, the Bank has marched
            forward into the ranks of the world’s large banks. In 2021, the Bank
            prepared the Group’s 14th Five-Year Plan, clarified its positioning
            and comparative advantages in the domestic economy and in the
            domestic and international economic flows, and focused on the
            development of the “Eight Priority Areas” of technology finance,
            green finance, inclusive finance, cross-border finance, consumer
            finance, wealth finance, supply chain finance and county-level
            finance. It moved faster in forming a strategic development
            landscape with its domestic commercial banking services as the
            business mainstay, its globalised operations and diversified
            business platforms as the two growth engines, and worked hard to
            write a new chapter of building a first-class global banking group.
          </p>

          <h4>Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited – Manila Branch</h4>
          <p>
            In the Philippines, Bank of China has a full commercial banking
            license and has been in operations since 2002. The Manila Branch’s
            mission is to be the bridge between Chinese and Philippine trade and
            investments through corporate banking, personal banking, and
            financial markets services, facilitating Chinese investments in key
            sectors of the fast-growing Philippine economy, investing in a
            Renminbi (RMB) transfer system to encourage the settlement of
            payments in RMB.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, the Philippines ranked first in RMB growth rate in
            Southeast Asia. In support of a growing local renminbi (RMB) market,
            Bank of China has been officially established as the RMB Clearing
            Bank of the Philippines. This follows the initial memorandum of
            understanding signed by the People’s Bank of China and the Bangko
            Sentral ng Pilipinas in 2019. As the designated clearing bank for
            RMB business in the Philippines, Bank of China Manila can process
            the settlement of accounts and other core RMB services such as
            remittance, foreign exchange, liquidity support, and banknotes for
            local participating banks. It can also provide local market
            participants with access to mainland China’s CNY onshore rates as an
            alternative to the more accessible offshore CNH rate. CNY is the RMB
            rate that can only be traded on-shore (in mainland China) or through
            Clearing Banks appointed by the PBOC internationally. By making it
            easier to trade with counterparties in mainland China, Bank of China
            Manila can help improve the economic and trade partnership to
            promote development between the Philippines and China.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bank of China provides matchmaking services to Philippine corporates
            and Chinese suppliers, which are clients of the Bank across more
            than 11,000 branches in China. We have brought our clients from
            China to invest in the Philippines and to partner with local firms
            as contractors and as providers of advanced technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moving forward, Bank of China aims to facilitate more Chinese
            investments in important sectors of the Philippine economy. Bank of
            China continues to work closely with Philippine and Chinese
            corporations to establish strong partnerships and make trade and
            investment between the two nations more efficient through the use of
            RMB as a settlement currency, for the inclusive growth of both
            countries.
